# Python3-basic-port-scanner
This is just a VERY basic port scanner that I built following the TCM PNPT live course. It is incredibly slow and actually worth using in the real world, but nonetheless I think it is a pretty cool little project. 

## How to use it
Just simply download the tool, navigate to the directory it is in and run the command ``` python3 scanner.py [ip here] ```. Placing whatever IP address that you want to scan in place of the ip here.
